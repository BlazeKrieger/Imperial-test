        <h3 id="stage-title1">BEST MOLECULE SELECTION</h3>
        <div id="stage1">
          We ran structure prediction of the wild type EsaR sequence on five software:
          RaptorX (the article is mainly about template-based prediction that we didn’t use,
          but it explains the template-free prediction as well, so might be useful for us),
          I-TASSER, Phyre, Robetta, and AlphaFold. A template structure was needed for I-TASSER and, hence,
          1H0M was used.<br><br>
          Check if there were any parameters needed <br>
          - I-TASSER needed a template<br>
          - How many iterations<br>
          - (1H0M was used as a template in PyMOL later to visualize the results from structure prediction)<br><br>
        </div>

        <h3 id="stage-title2">MUTATED GENE ASSEMBLY</h3>
        <div id="stage2">
          Firstly, we conducted automated binding site prediction in ProteinsPlus,
          while using 5 previously predicted structures.<br>
          Secondly, we docked the cognate ligand N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone within one of the 8 binding
          sites
          recognized by ProteinsPlus. For that, three softwares were used:
          DockThor, SwissDock, and AAl. Also, manual docking was conducted in PyMOL. <br>
          Later, PyMOL (the article goes through the dockings with PyMOL and Autodock/Vina which is similar to what we
          did
          with manual (PyMOL) and automated (DockThor, SwissDock) docking)
          was used to conduct two comparisons of results from DockThor and SwissDock,
          and manual and automated docking.<br><br>
        </div>

        <h3 id="stage-title3">SCREENING MUTANTS</h3>
        <div id="stage3">
          We did manual and automated protein-ligand interaction profiling in PyMOL and LigPlot, respectively. Docked
          and
          undocked structures were analyzed separately.
